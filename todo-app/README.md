# üìù Flask + MongoDB Todo App (Podman Compose)

A lightweight, containerized todo list application built with Flask and MongoDB, orchestrated using Podman Compose. This project demonstrates how to build a simple web app with persistent data storage, environment configuration, and container networking.


## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Frontend**: HTML rendered via Flask templates  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Containerization**: Podman Compose  
- **Persistence**: Named volumes for MongoDB data  


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root folder.
2. Ensure your `.env` file contains:

   ```env
   FLASK_ENV=development
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://db:27017/todo_db

## Build and Run The Container
podman-compose --env-file .env up --build --security-opt label=disable


üì¶ Why We Used Volumes (Not Bind Mounts)
We chose named volumes for MongoDB because:

They persist data across container rebuilds and restarts.

They are managed by Podman and isolated from host filesystem changes.

They avoid permission issues common with bind mounts on Linux/SELinux systems.

They simplify backup and portability.

Bind mounts are better suited for development when you want live code changes reflected instantly ‚Äî but for database storage, volumes are safer and more robust.

## Testing and Validation

## Volume Mount Inspection
To confirm MongoDB volume was mounted correctly:
podman inspect <db-container-name>

Look For:
"Mounts": [
  {
    "Type": "volume",
    "Name": "mongo-data",
    "Destination": "/data/db"
  }
]

## MongoDB Task Registration
Inside the flask container:

podman exec -it <web-container-name> sh
python

Then in Python:

from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient("mongodb://db:27017/")
db = client.todo_db
list(db.todos.find())

This confirms tasks are being stored in MongoDB.

## Network Connectivity
Inside the Flask container:

podman exec -it <web-container-name> sh
python

Then:
client.server_info()

If it returns server info, MongoDB is reachable.

## Persistence of The Volume After Restart
Add a task via the app.
Run:
podman-compose down
podman-compose up

Revisit http://localhost:5000 ‚Äî if the task is still there, persistence is working.

# Challenges and Resolution
Problem: Flask Container Not Starting
Cause: Missing requirements.txt or incorrect Dockerfile paths.

Fix: Move Dockerfile to root and use COPY app/requirements.txt ./ in Dockerfile.

Problem: .env Not Loaded
Cause: Podman Compose does not automatically load .env like Docker Compose.

Fix: Always run with:
podman-compose --env-file .env up --build

This explicitly loads environment variables. 
Docker Compose loads .env automatically ‚Äî but Podman Compose requires manual loading.
